The EMBARCATECH course, a joint venture between SOFTEX and IFMA, aims to equip participants with the technical skills essential for embedded systems development using C programming.

The firmwares created during the course are coded in C and deployed to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, a development board powered by a dual-core RP2040 microcontroller.

The Raspberry Pi Pico family, featuring models like Pi Pico, Pi Pico H, and Pi Pico W, all share the RP2040 microcontroller with its dual ARM Cortex-M0+ cores. This inaugural series of Raspberry Pi microcontroller-based products proved so successful that a second generation, employing the RP2350 with dual Cortex-M33 or Hazard3 cores, has been introduced.

Developers can write firmware in C, C/C++, or MicroPython, each with its own specific development environment setup requirements. Notably, configuring Visual Studio Code on Windows for C development can be quite complex, involving the installation of VS Code, the Arche32 compiler, the Pico SDK, and various extensions like C/C++ and cMakeTools.
